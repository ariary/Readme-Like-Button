## Bug bounty 

Sorry for the clickbait title, but no money will be provided for contibutors. 🐛 

Instead you will have your place in the Hall of fame of the repo.

Please, let us know if:
* you have a proposal for a "private" like button (ie we can't see who has already liked)
* you find a way to double like
* you find a way to withdraw someone else like
* you find a way to withdraw your like (when dislike is not implemented)
* anything you think that could be relevant
